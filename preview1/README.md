This is a service that renders a pdf-like html page.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repo
- Change `veriApiBase` in `js/controllers.js` to the url of the server that is running the VERi middleware
- Load webpage on browser starting at the `index.html` page
- Enter a valid `application id` or a url encoded json `application object` after the `/` in the url
- PDF page will be loaded
- For ios and android app, embed same url on viewcontroller and everything should load normally
